# ✈️ Cessna172-Hangar-Design

**Internship Project** | **AutoCAD & Fusion 360**  
Designing a dedicated aircraft hangar for a Cessna 172

---

## 📌 Project Description

This repository contains the design files and documentation for a hangar specifically built to house a **Cessna 172** light aircraft. The project was undertaken during my internship at **Vishwanath Projects Ltd**, where I worked as a **Design Intern**. The primary tools used were **AutoCAD** for 2D drafting and **Fusion 360** for 3D modeling and visualization.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- 🔷 **AutoCAD** – 2D design and layout of the hangar structure  
- 🧩 **Fusion 360** – 3D modeling, assembly, and visual representation  
- 📝 Project planning, dimensioning, and layout optimization
